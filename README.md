This course is the last course in a series of modules for data science.
This course assumes you have done the introduction in Python and the Data Analyses & Visualisation course https://github.com/raoulg/MADS-DAV

For this project you will need some dependencies.
The project uses python 3.10, and all dependencies can be installed with `pdm` if you are using that with `pdm install`.

The lessons can be found inside the `notebooks`folder.
The source code for the lessons can be found in the `src`folder.

--------

The `.lefthook.yml` file is used by [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook), and lints & cleans the code before I commit it. Because as a student you probably dont commit things, you can ignore it.

I have separated the management of datasets and the trainingloop code. You will find them as dependencies in the project:
- https://github.com/raoulg/mads_datasets
- https://github.com/raoulg/mltrainer

Both of these will be used a lot in the notebooks; by separating them it is easier for students to use the code in your own repositories.
